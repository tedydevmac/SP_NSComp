# SG60portal

## Inspiration
The functionality of the app was inspired by the information of the [official SG60 website](https://www.sg60.gov.sg/), alongside functionality of other apps that we and our seniors have made.

## Functionality
The app includes
- A timeline of major events in Singapore's history over the past 60 years, such as our independance from Malaysia, and some crisis that Singapore has gotten through as a nation
- A virtual photobooth, with custom props to celebrate Singapore's 60th birthday
- A countdown to 9/8/24, Singapore's national day and SG60
- A calendar of major events that are related to SG60, from the SG60 website
- A catalouge of randomly generated featured food, movies and music to celebrate Singapore's culture

## How we built it
We made the app using [![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-F54A2A?logo=swift&logoColor=white)](#) , off of designs made in [![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/Figma-F24E1E?logo=figma&logoColor=white)](#)
